===============================
My simple ``Makefile`` template
===============================

This is a place to store my ``Makefile`` template for C project, a simple one and no complicated setup. There are plenty on GitHub and Bitbucket, but they are usually too complex, so I decided to create this repository and I know everything I put in the file.

I am no where being versed in writing ``Makefile``, if you have any suggestions or tips, please feel free to open an issue.
